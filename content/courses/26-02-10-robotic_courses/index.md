Taking courses and reading books are very important for fresh researchers. Here, the courses and books are suitable for the researchers who are interesting in Computer Vision, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Deep Learning, Robotics, etc.

How can researchers improve themselves? Look at the figure above, researchers are "Agent". "state" means knowledge in brains. "reward" shows achievements.  "action" indicates practice. Reading books helps obtain knowledge (i.e., update "state"). At the same time, please apply the knowledge to applications (i.e., update "action"). Finally, the researchers will receive rewards, such as papers and decent jobs (i.e., update "reward").
