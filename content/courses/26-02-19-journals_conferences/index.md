Publication is strongly associated with the assessment of the quality of projects. Besides, publication is the primary way that science is communicated, validated, and advanced. Its importance spans several key areas: "Visibility and Reputation", "Scientific Impact", "Peer Review and Quality Assurance", "Collaboration Opportunities", and "Institutional and Societal Value".

In Finland, we use JUFO levels to group conferences and journals (See JUFO, https://jfp.csc.fi/jufoportal) 

At BISG-Robotics, researchers are expected to publish their work in the following conferences and journals.

### 1. Conferences with JUFO levels and deadlines
