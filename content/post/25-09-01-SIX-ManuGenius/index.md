SIX ManuGenius OULU is a nationally coordinated research project focusing on the role of generative artificial intelligence in the digital and green transition of the manufacturing industry. The project aims to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by providing research-based knowledge, practical pilots, and strategic roadmaps for the responsible adoption of generative AI technologies.

The project brings together universities, universities of applied sciences, development organizations, and industry partners across Finland to form a cross-regional collaboration network. Through applied research, pilot implementations, and close cooperation with companies, SIX ManuGenius OULU addresses both the opportunities and limitations of generative AI in manufacturing processes, supply chains, and supporting business functions.

The outcomes of the project include a national generative AI roadmap for manufacturing, validated pilot cases, scientific ublications, and a long-term collaboration framework aligned with the Sustainable Industry X (SIX) initiative and European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) principles.

The SIX ManuGenius project unites the research expertise of TAMK, TAU, JAMK, Savonia, Oulu University, Elinkeino-liikenne- ja ympäristökeskus, SeAMK, Into Seinäjoki and Business Tampere to build a comprehensive research and support framework for adopting generative AI in manufacturing SMEs. The project combines fundamental research on how generative AI works and where its limitations lie with applied research that helps companies implement AI solutions in practice. At the university of Oulu, the following research units participate: UBICOMP, BISG, and Industrial Engineering and Management.
