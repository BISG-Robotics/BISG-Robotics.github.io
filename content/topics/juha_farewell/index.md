Professor Juha Röning, the leader of BISG group, retired by the end of 2025. BISG group organized a farewell party for Juha.


Today we bid farewell to Professor Juha Röning, a visionary leader, pioneering researcher, and inspiring colleague whose influence has shaped not only a research group, but an entire field.

As the head of the Biomimetics and Intelligent Systems Group, Professor Juha Röning cultivated an environment where curiosity met rigor and innovation met real-world impact. Under his guidance, BISG became internationally recognized for its multidisciplinary excellence across data analysis, robotics, secure programming, and Bio-IT. These were not merely academic pursuits—they were engines of transformation, improving industrial manufacturing, advancing Industry 4.0, strengthening health and wellbeing technologies, enabling environmental monitoring through mobile robotics, and securing the connected world of IoT and seamless artificial-natural systems.

Yet beyond the achievements and accolades stands the legacy that matters most: the people he mentored, the minds he inspired, and the collaborative spirit he fostered. His leadership style reminded us that great science is not only about intelligence, but about integrity, generosity, and vision.

Professor Juha Röning leaves behind a community stronger, wiser, and more ambitious because of his presence. While we say farewell to him in this role, his influence will continue to guide future discoveries, future researchers, and future breakthroughs.

Thank you, Juha, for your leadership, your wisdom, and your unwavering dedication. Your work will endure—in our research, in our innovations, and in the spirit of inquiry you instilled in us all.
